# BACKGROUND INFO:

Jerry Seinfeld provided the following advice for an up and coming comedian: 
"…get a big wall calendar that has a whole year on one page and hang it on a prominent wall.
Get a big red magic marker. …for each day that you do your task of writing, …put a big red X over that day.”

I've used this adivce in my own life for many years to build better habits (like coding) . I've always wanted to make an app instead of printing out monthly calanders.
